# GooleSpaceInvaders
What if a Google search turned into an alien invasion? I set out to try using only basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project's goal is to expand this demo into a full game using real content from user’s search results after a search is completed. The boss battle will include making each letter in the Google logo come alive and attack the player.
